This is my Course Project for course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

R code of this Course Proect - on the GitHub repo: <https://github.com/vin2015-edem/ExData_Plotting1>
in folder "Course Project (Getting and Cleaning Data)" (I created this repo in other MOOC (I study them at the same time) and I'm so easy to use a ready-made repo).

####Note:
Setting of tasks is extremely muddled.
Explanations on the forum is not enough.
This is not correct to setting task.

I at first time pass a MOOC.
But I developing software since 1988 including for projects for UNEP, EU, GEF etc.

Unfortunately before the course I did not know the R language (and Markdown).

# DESCRIPTION OF MY COURSE PROJECT
1. At first I downloaded all files on PC into folder "D:/MOOC/Coursera_3_ Getting and Cleaning Data/Course Project/"
2. Unzip it.
3. Read files in variables (in memory of PC)
4. Merge of the test and train data for each parameters.
5. Uses descriptive names from Features.info in the data set.
6. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
7. Write table into file.

#####I don't understand how:
1. To use descriptive activity names from activity_labels.txt
2. To automated rename variables longer and understandable
I know how to do it by hand - each component separately, but I think the task is incorrect and unnecessary in life. It is unclear why such a task in this course. The variables and so clear. In programming, it is necessary to strive for brevity. Maybe I just do not understand the task?
3. Maybe I did not do something else.

#CodeBook
Variables and R cood are described in the Coodbook.
